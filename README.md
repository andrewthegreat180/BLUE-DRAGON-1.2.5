The provided MQL5 code is for a trading algorithm named "BLUE DRAGON 1.1.8" 

Developed by Alchemy Technologies. It implements a trading strategy based on the cross of two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with different periods. The trading strategy is as follows:

Here's a summary of the EA's key features:

The EA uses two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) with periods of 10 and 50 as indicators. The 10-period EMA is referred to as EMA10, and the 50-period EMA is referred to as EMA50.

Input parameters:

EMA10Period: The period of EMA10 (default: 10).

EMA50Period: The period of EMA50 (default: 50).

TakeProfit: Take profit value in points (default: 20000, equivalent to 200 pips).

StopLossPips: Stop loss value in points (default: 4500, equivalent to 450 pips).

MaxConsecutiveLosses: Maximum number of consecutive losses allowed (default: 2).

TradingPauseHours: The number of hours to pause trading after reaching MaxConsecutiveLosses (default: 48.0 hours).
TradesIn24Hours: Maximum number of trades allowed in 24 hours (default: 2).

TrailingStopPips: Trailing stop value in points (default: 50.0).

The OnInit() function initializes the EA by setting up the EMA indicators and calculating the StopLoss value.

The OnTick() function is called on every new tick. It performs the following tasks:

Update the tradesInLast24Hours variable.

Call the TrailingStop() function to manage the trailing stop.

Check if the maximum number of trades in 24 hours has been reached. If so, no new trades are placed.

If there's an open position, no new trades are placed.

If the consecutiveLosses variable has reached the MaxConsecutiveLosses value and the trading pause hasn't passed, no new trades are placed.

Calculate the EMA values and check for buy or sell signals. If a signal is detected, the corresponding trade is placed.

The OnTradeTransaction() function handles trade events, such as completed trades. It updates the consecutiveLosses variable and records the last trade time.

The OnDeinit() function handles the EA's deinitialization. Any necessary cleanup code can be added here.

The TrailingStop() function manages the trailing stop for open positions. It calculates the new stop loss level based on the trailing stop value and updates the stop loss for positions that meet the specified conditions.
